# AI Stats

> AI Stats is a web application for comparing AI model pricing, performance benchmarks, and technical specifications. Built with Astro, TypeScript, and Supabase, it provides real-time data visualization for models including GPT-4, Claude, Gemini, Llama, and more.

This project is a hobbyist tool inspired by Theo Browne's model-prices dashboard. All benchmark data is sourced from ArtificialAnalysis.com via their free API. The site uses NebulaSans custom font from Nebula.com.

Key features:
- Interactive comparison of AI model pricing (input/output token costs)
- Performance benchmarks including MMLU Pro, GPQA, HumanEval, and more
- Real-time data updates from ArtificialAnalysis API
- Responsive glassmorphism design with Rose Pine theme
- Filter and sort capabilities for custom comparisons
